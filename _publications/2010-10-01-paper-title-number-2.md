excerpt: 'We introduce a pioneering solution, the Multi-Scale Adaptive Transformer (mSAT). This innovative approach amalgamates a Domain Adaptive Network (DAN), adept at identifying continuous weather-invariant features across various scales, with a transformer network tailored for object detection. Our method is evaluated on the AIWD6 dataset, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the impact of adverse weather conditions on object detection. Our approach effectively mitigates the domain discrepancy, enabling adaptation to various continuous weather shifts. Later, we introduce three novel metrics for evaluating object detection performance on continuous weather data along with standard metrics.'
