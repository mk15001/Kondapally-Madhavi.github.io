Current ADAS systems perform well in clear weather but struggle under adverse and transitional weather conditions. These scenarios pose challenges like sudden visibility shifts and lighting changes, which can mislead perception systems and reduce safety. While extreme weather has been studied, transitional conditions common in realworld driving remain underexplored. They introduce unique issues like intermittent rain or fog that obscure road features subtly but significantly. Existing models using domain adaptation often fail to generalize due to limited weather diversity in training data.
